              Comprising of 333 islands, the archipelago of Fiji is a picture-perfect nirvana of
              blissful beaches and crystal-clear waters. The pace is slow and the landscapes are
              naturally beautiful, with friendly locals and sensational water sports only adding
              to the enviable charm that makes Fiji such an awe-inspiring destination.
            </p>
            <p>
              This place is truly akin to paradise, where cerulean seas meet powdery sands;
              where tropical flora meets with cascading waterfalls.  The climate is also a highlight
              of the region, where you can guarantee sun-kissed shores, balmy waters and cool island breezes.
              Few places can surpass the awe-inspiring beauty of Fiji.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take time out of revelling in the serenity of these islands to take a dip in the waters in search
              of colourful marine life; go white water rafting or kayaking for an adrenalin rush; visit the eco
              parks to seek out the remarkable wildlife or take part in a trek to the waterfalls to admire the
              breath-taking scenery. There’s an activity for everyone, from the active to the relaxed.

            <p>
              Officially the Republic of Fiji is an island country in Melanesia,
              part of Oceania in the South Pacific Ocean about 1,100 nautical miles
              (2,000 km; 1,300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island. 
              Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, 
              New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east,
              the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.
              Fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands—of which 110 are permanently
              inhabited—and more than 500 islets, amounting to a total land area of about 18,300 
              square kilometres (7,100 sq mi).
