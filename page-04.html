            <p>
              Seychelles is an archipelago located in the Indian Ocean which, between 480 and 1,600 km
              from the east coast of Africa. Despite this distance from the continent's mainland,
              the nation is, politically, part of Africa. The Seychelles consists of 115 islands,
              of which 42 are designated as granite or granitic islands, and 73 as coral islands.
              These islands are then sub-divided into the so-called Inner Islands and the Outer Islands.
              The Seychelles is also divided into 25 separate administrative regions, all of which are
              located on the Inner Islands. These islands are mostly made up of granite,
              but also include the Northern Coral Islands, while the Outer Islands consist
              of the Southern Coral Islands, the Amirantes, the Alphonse Group, the Farquhar Group,
              and the Aldabra Group.
