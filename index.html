            <h2>Dominican Republic</h2>
            <p class="writeup">
                If postcard-perfect beaches are what your dream holidays are made of, head to Punta Cana, 
                the Coconut Coast. This eastern province is known for its 20 miles of breathtaking white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters.
                <br><br>
                 Bávaro Beach and Playa Blanca are two of the best beaches on the island, while Macao Beach is UNESCO listed and a great spot for surfing.

            <h2>Mauritius</h2>

            <h2>Saint Lucia</h2>
            <p class="writeup">
                Sitting in between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, St Lucia boasts both an enviable location and 98 miles of luscious coastline
                 – the true definition of Caribbean paradise.
                 <br><br>
                  One of the most visually stunning Caribbean islands, 
                 St Lucia is decadently decorated with rolling verdant hills and circled by a ribbon of velvet beaches,

            <h2>Seychelles</h2>

                this stunning archipelago nation boasts beautiful beaches, abundant tropical wildlife both on land and in the sea.

            <h2>Bora Bora</h2>
            <p class="writeup">
                Once seen, Bora Bora is never forgotten. From the day you arrive until the moment you part ways, 
                you will be in awe of how her soaring mountain peaks, turquoise lagoon and luxuriant overwater bungalows somehow look even more spectacular than the pictures.
                <br><br>
                Bora Bora may feel worlds away, but this South Seas splendor is well within reach.

                by boat to your Bora Bora resort, meaning you hardly have to wait for your first
                encounter with the island's famously translucent lagoon.

            <h2>Bali</h2>
            <p class="writeup">
                Bali has to be seen to be believed. A beautiful cultural oasis, 
                ‘the Island of the Gods’ features thousands of temples and a rich spiritual heritage,
                plus gorgeous beaches, colourful scenery and a relaxing atmosphere.
                You’ll never find a consensus on Bali’s best feature, 
                but everyone agrees that Bali is one of the world’s most diverse destinations.
                <br><br>
                The island is home to religious sites such as cliffside Uluwatu Temple.
                To the south, the beachside city of Kuta has lively bars, while Seminyak,
                Sanur and Nusa Dua are popular resort towns. The island is also known for its yoga and meditation retreats.

            <h2>Fiji</h2>
            <p class="writeup">
                Of the 330 islands that make up the Fiji archipelago barely 100 are inhabited,
                 so it is still possible to stumble across deserted beaches, discover tumbling waterfalls in the jungle,
                 dive off pristine coral reefs and visit tiny local villages that still follow a traditional way of life.
                 <br><br>
                 Look out for village roadside stalls selling seasonal fruit or local hot corn.
                  Many of the beaches offer serene, crystal clear swimming conditions perfect for 
                  families with young children. 
                    If you surf, you can be lucky enough to catch a wave when conditions are right.
