            As a part of the archipelago of Indonesia, Bali is an island in the middle of country
            with other Indonesian islands either side of it and Malaysia to the north.
            It is a true paradise with forest-clad hills, jutting mountains and perfect beaches.
            <br><br>
            Bali is a rare place with something to suit every traveller. Culture lovers can delve
            in Bali’s spiritual past, sun seekers can lounge on volcanic black sand beaches and
            foodies will be mesmerised by the choice of dishes on offer throughout the island.
            <br><br>
            Rich in temples and entrenched in their own unique cultural heritage, Bali’s
            people are simultaneously warm, welcoming and subdued. Unlike Indonesia’s predominantly 
            Muslim population, the citizens of Bali are primarily Hindu making it quite a different
            experience from much of the country.

          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>
            Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands.
            Located east of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali
            and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and
            Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the
            Lesser Sunda Islands and the second largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia.
